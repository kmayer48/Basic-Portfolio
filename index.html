                        Born and raised in Reston, Virginia. Attended college in Blacksburg, VA at Virginia Tech where I majored in Financial Planning. Currently living in Washington, DC. I have been in DC for three years and have fallen in love with the city. 
                        I am excited to be a part of the GW coding bootcamp with the goal of pursing a career in web development.

                        I enjoy playing sports, being outdoors, playing video games, and spending time with friends and family. My favorite thing to do is travel and be by the ocean. My favorite outdoor activity is stand-up paddleboarding.

            Born and raised in Reston, Virginia. Attended college in Blacksburg, VA at Virginia Tech. Currently living in Washington, DC. I have been in DC for three years and have fallen in love with the city.

            I enjoy playing sports, being outdoors, playing video games, and spending time with friends and family. My favorite thing to do is travel and be by the ocean. My favorite outdoor activity is stand-up paddleboarding.
